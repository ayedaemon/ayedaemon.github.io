When writing a program, we often use names to reference objects in our code, like function names and variable names. These names are commonly referred to as symbols. (yeah, deal with it now!)

Creating multiple small programs for this article will provide a clearer and more comprehensive understanding of the topic.

```c
/*
File: libarithmatic.c
*/

float addFunc (float a, float b) {
    return a + b;
}

float subFunc (float a, float b) {
    return a - b;
}

float mulFunc (float a, float b) {
    return a * b;
}

float divFunc (float a, float b) {
    if (b == 0) {
        return 0.0;
    }
    return a / b;
}

```


```c
/*
File: libarithmatic.h
*/

#ifndef ARITHMATIC_H
#define ARITHMATIC_H

float addFunc (float, float);
float subFunc (float, float);
float mulFunc (float, float);
float divFunc (float, float);

float magicFunc (float a, float b);
#endif
```


```c
/*
File: main.c
*/

#include <stdio.h>
#include "libarithmatic.h"


int main() {
    float num1, num2, result;
    char operator;

    printf("Enter equation (9 * 6): ");
    scanf("%f %c %f", &num1, &operator, &num2);

    switch (operator) {
        case '+':
            result = addFunc(num1, num2);
            break;
        case '-':
            result = subFunc(num1, num2);
            break;
        case '*':
            result = mulFunc(num1, num2);
            break;
        case '/':
            result = divFunc(num1, num2);
            break;
        default:
            printf("Invalid operator\n");
            return 1;
    }

    printf("Result: %.2f\n", result);

    return 0;
}

```


This is generally what most of the real-world projects do, they create multiple files with different functionalities and then merge them together to complete the program with the desired features only.

This is our first time so far writing multiple files for a program. So let's take some time to understand how this works in C.

First, we create a `libarithmatic.c` file with all of the required arithmatic functions. Since this file contains these functions (function definitions), the intermediate object file for this file will have related information as well.

Then comes the `main.c` file, where we have declared the `main` function. Inside the main function, we have used other functions which are not defined in the `main.c` file. These are defined by the header files - `<stdio.h>` and `"libarithmatic.h"`.


Now the process to create these object files and combining them is quite simple... There are 3 phases involved:

1. **Compilation**: Read source code and generate assembly code from it.
2. **Assembling**: Reads the assembly code and generates machine code from it.
3. **Linking**: Reads the machine code and links objects in correct places & order.


Now if you perform steps 1&2 on both files individually to get separate object files and then use those object files to perform step 3, you'll get a single ELF executable binary that has all of the functionality in one file.

Luckily `gcc` provides some features, that helps us to make this even easier.

```
‚ùØ gcc --help
Usage: gcc [options] file...
Options:
<... OMITTED ...>
  -E                       Preprocess only; do not compile, assemble or link.
  -S                       Compile only; do not assemble or link.
  -c                       Compile and assemble, but do not link.
```

So if you follow these commands, you'll get the desired files

```sh
# Compile + assemble -> generates main.o
gcc -c main.c

# Compile + assemble -> generates libarithmatic.o
gcc -c libarithmatic.c

# Linking -> generates calc
gcc main.o libarithmatic.o -o calc
```



## Symbol tables
Before we start our analysis, it's important to understand what we're about to examine. Unlike string tables, symbol tables have a well-defined structure, and both Glibc and the Linux kernel define a struct for this (`Elf64_Sym` for 64-bit files).


```c
/*
Glibc
https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/elf.h;hb=2bd00179885928fd95fcabfafc50e7b5c6e660d2#l530
*/

typedef struct
{
  Elf64_Word    st_name;                /* Symbol name (string tbl index) */
  unsigned char st_info;                /* Symbol type and binding */
  unsigned char st_other;               /* Symbol visibility */
  Elf64_Section st_shndx;               /* Section index */
  Elf64_Addr    st_value;               /* Symbol value */
  Elf64_Xword   st_size;                /* Symbol size */
} Elf64_Sym;

/*
Linux kernel v6.5.8
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.8/source/include/uapi/linux/elf.h#L197
*/

typedef struct elf64_sym {
  Elf64_Word    st_name;		/* Symbol name, index in string tbl */
  unsigned char	st_info;	    /* Type and binding attributes */
  unsigned char	st_other;	    /* No defined meaning, 0 */
  Elf64_Half    st_shndx;		/* Associated section index */
  Elf64_Addr    st_value;		/* Value of the symbol */
  Elf64_Xword   st_size;		/* Associated symbol size */
} Elf64_Sym;

```

### st_name

Similar to other name fields in the ELF specification, this member stores the index or offset in the associated string table.

### st_info

This member represents a combined value derived from two different but related attributes: `bind` and `type`.

Both, [Kernel](https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.8/source/include/uapi/linux/elf.h#L136) and [glibc](https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/elf.h;hb=2bd00179885928fd95fcabfafc50e7b5c6e660d2#l572) provide definitions and macros to work with this member.

#### 1. Bind

The "bind" bits provide information about where this symbol can be seen and used.. There are 3 kinds of binding defined by linux kernel

```c
/*
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.8/source/include/uapi/linux/elf.h#L123
*/
#define STB_LOCAL  0    /* not visible outside the object file */
#define STB_GLOBAL 1    /* visible to all object files */
#define STB_WEAK   2    /* like globals, but with lower precedence */
```

But glibc adds few more to this list

```c
/*
https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/elf.h;hb=2bd00179885928fd95fcabfafc50e7b5c6e660d2#l582
*/
#define STB_LOCAL       0               /* Local symbol */
#define STB_GLOBAL      1               /* Global symbol */
#define STB_WEAK        2               /* Weak symbol */
#define STB_NUM         3               /* Number of defined types.  */
#define STB_LOOS        10              /* Start of OS-specific */
#define STB_GNU_UNIQUE  10              /* Unique symbol.  */
#define STB_HIOS        12              /* End of OS-specific */
#define STB_LOPROC      13              /* Start of processor-specific */
#define STB_HIPROC      15              /* End of processor-specific */
```

Kernel and glibc both provide a macro to extract the `bind` value from the provided `st_info` member - `#define ELF_ST_BIND(x)	((x) >> 4)`

#### 2. Type

`type` bits tells about the type of symbol - function, file, variable, etc. A general classification for the symbol.

Linux kernel defines total 7 types

```c
/*
https://elixir.bootlin.com/linux/v6.5.8/source/include/uapi/linux/elf.h#L128
*/

#define STT_NOTYPE  0   /* Unspecified */
#define STT_OBJECT  1   /* data objects like variables, arrays, etc*/
#define STT_FUNC    2   /* functions or other executable codes*/
#define STT_SECTION 3   /* associated with a section;
                           mainly used for relocations
                           (we'll see relocations in later articles)*/
#define STT_FILE    4   /* name of the source file*/
#define STT_COMMON  5   /* just like STT_OBJECT, but for tentative values */
#define STT_TLS     6   /* stores thread local data which is unique to each thread */
```

And again our beloved glibc expanded these definitions

```c
/*
https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/elf.h;hb=2bd00179885928fd95fcabfafc50e7b5c6e660d2#l595
*/
#define STT_NOTYPE      0               /* Symbol type is unspecified */
#define STT_OBJECT      1               /* Symbol is a data object */
#define STT_FUNC        2               /* Symbol is a code object */
#define STT_SECTION     3               /* Symbol associated with a section */
#define STT_FILE        4               /* Symbol's name is file name */
#define STT_COMMON      5               /* Symbol is a common data object */
#define STT_TLS         6               /* Symbol is thread-local data object*/
#define STT_NUM         7               /* Number of defined types.  */
#define STT_LOOS        10              /* Start of OS-specific */
#define STT_GNU_IFUNC   10              /* Symbol is indirect code object */
#define STT_HIOS        12              /* End of OS-specific */
#define STT_LOPROC      13              /* Start of processor-specific */
#define STT_HIPROC      15              /* End of processor-specific */
```

Kernel and glibc both provide a macro to extract the `type` value from the provided `st_info` member - `#define ELF_ST_TYPE(x)    ((x) & 0xf)`

### st_other

If you examine the `Elf64_Sym` struct in both the kernel and Glibc source code, you'll notice that the kernel doesn't currently have any use case for this field and marks it as such. However, Glibc uses this field to track the visibility of the symbol.

```
/*
https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=blob;f=elf/elf.h;hb=2bd00179885928fd95fcabfafc50e7b5c6e660d2#l626
*/
#define STV_DEFAULT     0               /* Default symbol visibility rules - as specified by symbol binding*/
#define STV_INTERNAL    1               /* Processor specific hidden class */
#define STV_HIDDEN      2               /* Sym unavailable in other modules */
#define STV_PROTECTED   3               /* Not preemptible, not exported */
```

From what I understand, **symbol visibility** (*yup, this is what glibc calls `st_other`*) extends the concept of **symbol binding** and provides more control over symbol access.

Let's use an example to grasp this concept better. Imagine we create an `addFunc` function in both the `main.c` file and the `libarithmatic.c` file, then **compile** and **assemble** the code separately. This scenario leads to symbol clashes.

*While I understand this example might not be highly practical, it illustrates the need for more precise control beyond what the `st_info`'s "**bind**" bits can offer. This is where the `st_other` visibility attribute becomes crucial.*

### st_shndx


This attribute indicates the section associated with this symbol. It holds the section index corresponding to the sections in the section header.

### st_value

Indeed, each symbol should have both a name and an associated value. This member holds the value associated with the symbol.

### st_size

Many symbols come with associated sizes, for function type symbols this will be the size of that function. If a symbol doesn't have a size or its size is unknown, this member holds a value of zero.





## Analysis

Now that we have a foundational understanding, we can apply this knowledge to analyze our previous files

### 1. `libarithmatic.o`

To keep things straightforward, I'll begin by listing all the sections in the `libarithmatic.o` file.

In addition to the typical `.shstrtab`, this file also contains a `.strab` (another string table) that holds the names of functions defined in `libarithmatic.c`.


```
[ 10 ] Section Name: .strtab        Type: 0x3       Flags: 0x0      Addr: 0x0       Offset: 0x250           Size: 49        Link: 0         Info: 0x0       Addralign: 0x1          Entsize: 0
     [    0 ]
     [    1 ] libarithmatic.c
     [   17 ] addFunc
     [   25 ] subFunc
     [   33 ] mulFunc
     [   41 ] divFunc
```

Names alone can be quite limited in terms of usefulness. To make sense of them, you typically need more information, and this additional data is stored in symbol tables.

Here is the symbol table for above mentioned names.

Question: How do I know this is the symbol table for the above string table.

Answer: Check the `sh_link` value on symbol table section, this points to section `10` (`.strtab`).

```
[ 09 ] Section Name: .symtab        Type: 0x2       Flags: 0x0      Addr: 0x0       Offset: 0x1a8           Size: 168       Link: 10        Info: 0x3       Addralign: 0x8          Entsize: 24
     [  0 ] Name:                       Info: 0x00 (Bind: 0x0 | Type: 0x0)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x0      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  1 ] Name: libarithmatic.c       Info: 0x04 (Bind: 0x0 | Type: 0x4)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0xfff1   Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  2 ] Name:                       Info: 0x03 (Bind: 0x0 | Type: 0x3)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x1      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  3 ] Name: addFunc               Info: 0x18 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x2)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x1      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x1a
     [  4 ] Name: subFunc               Info: 0x18 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x2)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x1      Value: 0x00000000001a   Size: 0x1a
     [  5 ] Name: mulFunc               Info: 0x18 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x2)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x1      Value: 0x000000000034   Size: 0x1a
     [  6 ] Name: divFunc               Info: 0x18 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x2)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x1      Value: 0x00000000004e   Size: 0x34
```

If you're using tools like `xxd` or `hexdump` that display the raw values from the file, you'll see indices to the names rather than the actual names. To determine which section holds the strings for these indices, you can inspect the "Link" value in this section.

*Modifying this value can lead to confusion and misguidance for anybody reading it, even your computer* üòà



For the sake of simplicity and the scope of this article, I'll focus on discussing the four functions in this table and leave the rest for you to explore and learn.


We can observe that the `st_info` value for all of these symbols is the same, which implies that their "**bind**" and "**type**" values are identical (*duhh*). According to the information we've gathered, these symbols are `GLOBAL` (bind=0x1) and of `FUNC` (type=0x2) type. This indicates that these symbols can be called from other files as well.


It's worth noting that there's a very cool tool called ["**ftrace**" by elfmaster](https://github.com/elfmaster/ftrace/), which utilizes [this information](https://github.com/elfmaster/ftrace/blob/master/ftrace.c#L441) to trace function calls, specifically focusing on function calls and not other symbols.



Furthermore, the `st_other` field is empty for these members, indicating `default` symbol visibility. There's nothing noteworthy to discuss here.

Now, let's move on to the `sh_shndx` (section index) member. This member tells us that all of these symbols are associated with section `0x1` (which is `.text`, and that does make sense -- Code of these functions should be in `.text` section only).

The `st_value` field indicates the offset within the `.text` section at which these functions begin. So, if you start executing instructions from offset `0x34` in the `.text` section, you'll be running the `mulFunc` function. *Makes sense??*


Interestingly, there's a complete phase in the process where these symbols are replaced with their respective values after further processing. At some point, we will no longer need the string "mulFunc." Instead, every instance in the code where this function is used is replaced with the processed value, and this process is referred to as `relocation`. (This topic will be discussed in greater detail in upcoming articles.)


Last but not least, the `st_size` field provides the size of the function. This helps the magical entity reading the code determine when to stop and understand the boundaries of the function.


### 2. `main.o`


Performing the same initial process for the `main.o` file, you will be able yield its symbol table, as shown below.


```
 [ 11 ] Section Name: .symtab       Type: 0x2       Flags: 0x0      Addr: 0x0       Offset: 0x248           Size: 312       Link: 12        Info: 0x4       Addralign: 0x8          Entsize: 24
     [  0 ] Name:                    Info: 0x00 (Bind: 0x0 | Type: 0x0)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x0      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  1 ] Name: main.c             Info: 0x04 (Bind: 0x0 | Type: 0x4)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0xfff1   Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  2 ] Name:                    Info: 0x03 (Bind: 0x0 | Type: 0x3)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x1      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  3 ] Name:                    Info: 0x03 (Bind: 0x0 | Type: 0x3)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x5      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  4 ] Name: main               Info: 0x18 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x2)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x1      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x143
     [  5 ] Name: printf             Info: 0x16 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x0)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x0      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  6 ] Name: __isoc99_scanf     Info: 0x16 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x0)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x0      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  7 ] Name: addFunc            Info: 0x16 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x0)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x0      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  8 ] Name: subFunc            Info: 0x16 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x0)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x0      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [  9 ] Name: mulFunc            Info: 0x16 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x0)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x0      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [ 10 ] Name: divFunc            Info: 0x16 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x0)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x0      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [ 11 ] Name: puts               Info: 0x16 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x0)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x0      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
     [ 12 ] Name: __stack_chk_fail   Info: 0x16 (Bind: 0x1 | Type: 0x0)      Other: 0x0      Shndx: 0x0      Value: 0x000000000000   Size: 0x0
```


In this case, things get a bit more interesting. Let's begin with the same set of symbols: `addFunc`, `subFunc`, `mulFunc`, and `divFunc`.

You'll notice that these symbols are global, but they don't have any associated types. This is expected since the symbols are not defined in this file; they are just being called. At this stage, we're not certain if there's anything like these symbols elsewhere, which is why all the other members are zeroed out (undefined). This essentially instructs the *magical* linker to locate the values of these symbols (linkers are pretty good at this; they will give errors if the symbols aren't found).

Now, you'll also notice the presence of `printf` and `puts` symbols. This may raise a question: "**I didn't use puts in my code, so why is it there?**"

Answer: It's compiler magic! The compiler observed that the line `printf("Enter equation (9 * 6): ");` could be expressed as `puts("Enter equation (9 * 6): ");`, so it made this conversion during compilation. To confirm this, you can generate the compiled code using `gcc -S`.


Now, let's examine our mighty `main` symbol. The `st_info` indicates that it's a `GLOBAL` `function` (with `bind=0x1` and `type=0x2`). This function is located in the 1st section (`sh_shndx: 0x1`) of `main.o`, which in this case is the `.text` section. The function begins at offset `0x0`, and its size is `0x143`. *Pretty simple, right?*

(Note: I'm leaving `__isoc99_scanf` and `__stack_chk_fail` for you. Google them!)



### 3. `calc`

This represents the ultimate outcome of the entire compilation, assembly, and linking process‚Äîthe final ELF executable binary. However, the process to obtain its **symbol table** remains same.

Here is the `symtab` for this ELF binary

The linking process did introduce numerous symbols that exceed the combined count of symbols in both individual object files. To keep things simple (* *once again* *), we won't dive into the specifics of what these additional symbols do, and we can think of them as a result of linker magic.

Our primary focus for now remains on the symbols and their properties, even if we don't have detailed knowledge of their functions.

These are the symbols we defined ourselves...

We can observe the similarities in various members between `libarithmatic.o` and `main.o`. The notable difference I can identify is the `sh_shndx` value, which has changed but still points to the `.text` section of `calc`. The crucial point is that it should reference the `.text` section, regardless of the section index value.

Another difference is in the `st_value`. With the addition of numerous new symbols in this file, the positions of these symbols have shifted. Initially, we had the `main` function in `main.o` and `addFunc` in `libarithmatic.o`, both at offset `0x0`. However, when combining them into a single file, one of them had to adjust its offset to make room for the other. This is precisely what occurred here, and there are also other symbols (of function type) that occupied the initial offsets, causing our defined functions to compromise on their offsets.

One more intriguing detail is the `_start` symbol, which has an offset of `0x000000001070`. This offset serves as the entry point of our ELF executable binary. You can verify this using `readelf` or any method you prefer.


I'm done for today now, ta-ta!
